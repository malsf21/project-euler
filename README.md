# project-euler

These are my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about). Am I good at programming problems (or programming in general)? No - which is why I'm giving this a shot!

So far, I'm writing all of my answers in Python 3 - you can find them in the `python/` folder. I've only posted solutions that I've gotten correct.
