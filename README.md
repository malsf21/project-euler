# project-euler

These are my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about). Am I good at programming problems (or programming in general)? No - which is why I'm giving this a shot!

So far, I'm writing most of my answers in Python 3 - you can find those in the `python/` folder. I'm also dabbling with using other languages to complete problems that I've already solved (Haskell right now!). I've only posted solutions that I've gotten correct - if you run the locally, you should get the right answer too.
